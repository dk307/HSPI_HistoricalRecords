<span class="font-italic">Average Linear</span>
<label class="fw-lighter font-weight-light">Calculate the average value of stored values, taking into account the time intervals between them. This method employs linear interpolation for each stored pair and is particularly useful for monitoring source sensors with irregular updates and when the records represent continuous behavior, such as outdoor temperature.</label>

<p>
<span class="font-italic">Average Step</span>
<label class="fw-lighter font-weight-light">Compute the average value of stored values while accounting for the time intervals between them. This approach utilizes LOCF (last observation carried forward weighting), assuming the previous value between the interval. The resulting step function effectively captures the behavior of non-continuous data, such as the set temperature of a boiler.</label>

<label class="fw-lighter font-weight-light">Determine the minimum value from the values. Only the devices changes recorded in the duration are considered.</label>
